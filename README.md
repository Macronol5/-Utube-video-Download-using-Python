# -Utube-video-Download-using-Python

This is just a two-line program but to convert it to GUI YouTube Video Downloader Application this is a bit longer but still, this program of GUI YouTube Video Downloader Application is less than 25 lines.

But still, if you want that two line program then click here.

We have explained this program at every line to make it understand easily for you.

We have created two entry widgets, one to ask the user to enter URL or link of YouTube video and others to add that link.

Then, we have called the download function using the “Download Video” button.

You can download the pytube module using"pip install pytube" but if this gives you the error then you should try "pip install pytube3" inside your terminal.

Now, let’s see the code and understand.
